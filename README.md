# InterPose
Interpolation-Pose algorithms implementation.  
I implemented 2 methods.   
1. Quarternion + R^3  
Generally pose is described by rotation and translation. In this method, rotation is interpolated by Quarternion slerp, and translation is interpolated linearly. Interpolated trajectory generated by this is a street line. 
2. SE(3)  
In this method, pose is described by SE(3). If you need smooth trajectory, this is better.

## How to use
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:cashiwamochi/InterPose.git
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
./build/bin/exampleInterPose
```

## Example
Red poses are source pose and destination pose. Yellow poses are generated by SE3-interpolation and blue poses are generated by Quat+R^3-interpolation.

### Note
SE(3)-interpolation looks woking incorrecly in some cases. I'm investigating reason.
